** Exhaustive and Historical Coverage
  We will mostly focus on the *state-of-the-art*

** System Virtual Machines
  We will only talk about *language* Virtual Machines
  (a.k.a. Managed Runtime Systems)

** Compilers
  We will only talk about *JIT* compilation

  We *won't* cover compiler theory exhaustively

*4 hours* of lectures per week
*7* reading assignments + summary
*1* project + presentation
