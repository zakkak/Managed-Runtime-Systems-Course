** Exhaustive and Historical Coverage
  We will mostly focus on the {{{alert(state-of-the-art)}}}

** System Virtual Machines
  We will only talk about {{{alert(language)}}} Virtual Machines
  (a.k.a. Managed Runtime Systems)

** Compilers

  We {{{alert(won't)}}} cover compiler theory exhaustively

* The Course's Workload

** The Course's Workload
{{{alert(4 hours)}}} of lectures per week
{{{alert(7)}}} reading assignments + summary
{{{alert(1)}}} project + presentation

** Project
Work {{{alert(solo)}}} or in {{{alert(pairs of two)}}}

Focus on {{{alert(JIT compilation)}}} or {{{alert(Garbage Collection)}}} on {{{alert(GraalVM)}}} or {{{alert(Maxine VM)}}}
  (alternative interesting topics are also welcome)

** Project proposals
